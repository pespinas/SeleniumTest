## Shopping Cart Automation Project with Selenium WebDriver

This project automates testing functionalities of a shopping cart on an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver.

**Version:** <FILL_IN_VERSION_HERE> (Replace with your project's version number)

**What you'll need:**

* Basic understanding of Selenium WebDriver
* Proficiency in Python, Java, or C#
* Access to an e-commerce website

**Steps:**

1. **Website Analysis & Test Case Definition:**
    * Identify shopping cart elements using locators (e.g., ID, class name, XPath, CSS selector).
    * Define various test scenarios (adding/removing products, modifying quantities, checkout flow, etc.).

2. **Selenium Script Development:**
    * Write scripts to automate the defined test cases in your chosen programming language.
    * Utilize `WebDriverWait` to ensure elements load before interacting.
    * Implement assertions (e.g., using `assertEquals` or similar functions) to verify expected results.
    * Consider using a testing framework like JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), or NUnit (C#) for better organization and maintainability.

3. **Test Execution & Debugging:**
    * Run the Selenium scripts and verify successful test execution.
    * Employ debugging techniques (print statements, logging, debuggers) to identify and fix any encountered errors.

4. **Project Documentation:**
    * Create a document outlining the project, test cases, and Selenium scripts.
    * Consider including screenshots or video recordings of test executions for clarity.

**Benefits:**

This project enhances your skills in Selenium WebDriver and test automation, providing valuable experience in:

* Automating e-commerce website interactions
* Implementing Selenium WebDriver functionalities effectively
* Writing and debugging automated test scripts
* Understanding the importance of test case definition and clear documentation
* (Optional) Working with testing frameworks for improved organization

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex test automation frameworks and contributes to a robust testing strategy for e-commerce websites!
